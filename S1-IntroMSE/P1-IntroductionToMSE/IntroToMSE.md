# What is MSE?

\note{
- IOTC starting into MSE
- A brief definition

- Comparison with TA
}

**Testing** the **performance** of a **Management Procedure** to deliver a set of **objectives** under **uncertainty** and for a range of scenarios.

# SA-based SC advice

- Best stock assessment
- Comparison with reference points
- Yearly assessment + advice 

# SA outputs

# SA-based SC advice

## Problems

- SA uncertain or wrong
- Inter-annual changes in SA
- Short time horizon
- Management objectives unclear
- Stakeholder distance

# The 6 STEPS

1. Specify & prioritize objectives
2. Quantify them as performance measures
3. Develop a set of OMs
	- Condition on data
4. Identify candidate MPs (SA + HCR)
5. Simulate the future
	- Generate data
	- Determine management action
	- Apply to fleet and stock
6. Summarize performance of MPs
7. Select best MP

# OM

# Feedback control

- Lag in management in RFMO using SA

# Decision rules

- Agree rules of game before start playing

- Data + Decision rule + Management

- EXAMPLES

# Testing decision rules under uncertainty

# Advantages

- Evaluation of risk
- Robust performance over tracking noise in data
- Limits catch variability
- Consistent with PA
- Interaction among scientists, managers & stakeholders
- Default management if no agreement
- Less haggling for short term benefits

# Disadvantages

- Lengthy complex development (but less and less so)
- Overly rigid
- Autopiloting?
- Poor data, poor models
- Choosing scenarios, test cases

Prediction is very difficult, specially if it is about the future

-- Niels Bohr

# Limitations

- Not all possible scenarios covered

# Trade Offs

# QUESTIONS?

# A brief history of MSE

- IWC NMP (1974): B, K, MSY, C limits
- Arguments on parameters and uncertainty
- IWC RMP (1992)

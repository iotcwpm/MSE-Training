% Demonstration session on Management Strategy Evaluation
% Working Party on Methods
% IOTC SC16 2013, Busan, Korea

# OBJECTIVE

The aim of this session is to introduce SC members to Management Strategy Evaluation and simulation testing of management procedures. We intend to explain some fundamental concepts behind the use of stochastic simulation for comparing the relative performance merits of alternative management procedures, explain some of the details behind the work carried out by WPM to implement them, and show a simple but useful running example for participants to interact with.

# ORGANIZATION

- To be run over three 30' sessions
- 2-3 demonstrators
- A set of prepared alternative simulations is to be run in advance, so results are available on the fly. But code should be kept simple enough that alternative formulations can be run in a short while.

# PROGRAMME

## 1. Introduction to MSE (30')

### PRESENTATION 1: What is MSE? (10')

- Definitions
	- Risk
	- Uncertainty
	- Simulation
- Very brief history
- SA-based advice: problems
- Decision rules
- Testing decision rules: MSE
- 6 steps
- Advantages
- Disadvantages
- Limitations
- Trade-offs
- MSE @ IOTC

### PRESENTATION 2: Simulating the fishery system (15')

- The "real" population: Operating Models
	- The stock
	- The fleets
- The scientific advice process
	- Data collection & preparation
	- Stock Assessment
	- Reference Points
	- Projections & advice
- The management system
	- Implementation

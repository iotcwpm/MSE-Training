# What is MSE?

\note{
NOTE
}

- Robust to uncertainty
- Plausible uncertainty


# Definitions

- Risk
- Uncertainty
- Simulation

# A brief history of MSE

- IWC NMP (1976): B, K, MSY
- IWC MPA

\note{
- Wrong SA
- Inter-annual variation
}

# SA-based SC advice

## Problems

- SA uncertain or wrong
- Inter-annual changes in SA
- Short time horizon
- Management objectives unclear
- Stakeholder distance

# Feedback control

- Lag in management in RFMO using SA

# Decision rules

- Agree rules of game before start playing

- Data + Decision rule + Management

- EXAMPLES

# Testing decision rules under uncertainty

# The 6 STEPS

1. Specify & prioritize objectives
2. Quantify them as performance measures
3. Develop a set of OMs
	- Condition on data
4. Identify candidate MPs (SA + HCR)
5. Simulate the future
	- Generate data
	- Determine management action
	- Apply to fleet and stock
6. Summarize performance of MPs
7. Select best MP

# Advantages
- Less haggling for short term benefits
- Evaluation of risk
- Limits catch variability
- Consistent with PA
- Interaction among scientists, managers & stakeholders
- Default management if no agreement
- Robust performance over tracking noise in data

# Disadvantages
- Lengthy complex development (but less and less so)
- Overly rigid
- Autopiloting?
- Poor data, poor models
- Choosing scenarios, test cases

## Limitations

# Trade Offs

# MSE at IOTC

- Current status
- Future work

Prediction is very difficult, specially if it is about the future

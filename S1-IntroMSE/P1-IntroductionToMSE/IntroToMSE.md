# What is MSE?

\note{
- IOTC starting into MSE
- A brief definition

- Comparison with TA
}

**Testing** the **performance** of a **Management Procedure** to deliver a set of **objectives** under **uncertainty** and for a range of scenarios.

# SA-based SC advice

- Best stock assessment
- Comparison with reference points
- Yearly assessment + advice 

# SA-based SC advice

## Problems

- SA uncertain or wrong
- Inter-annual changes in SA
- Short time horizon
- Management objectives unclear
- Stakeholder distance

# MSE output

- Performance of Management System under uncertainty

# The 6 STEPS

1. Specify & prioritize objectives
2. Quantify them as performance measures
3. Develop a set of OMs
	- Condition on data
4. Identify candidate MPs (SA + HCR)
5. Simulate the future
	- Generate data
	- Determine management action
	- Apply to fleet and stock
6. Summarize performance of MPs
7. Select best MP

# Feedback control

- Lag in management in RFMO using SA

# Decision rules

- Agree rules of game before start playing

- Data + Decision rule + Management

# Example HCR

- ALB CPUE

- ALB SP

# Testing decision rules under uncertainty

# Advantages

- Evaluation of risk
- Robust performance over tracking noise in data
- Limits catch variability
- Consistent with PA
- Interaction among scientists, managers & stakeholders
- Default management if no agreement
- Less haggling for short term benefits

# Disadvantages

- Lengthy complex development (but less and less so)
- Overly rigid
- Autopiloting?
- Poor data, poor models
- Choosing scenarios, test cases
- Not all possible scenarios covered

Prediction is very difficult, specially if it is about the future

-- Niels Bohr

# Risk

Probability of some undesired event happening

- Farmer: sell your crop or sell later at (possibly) higher price?
- Investment: Keep shares while they rise or sell before they fall?

# Dilemma of low biomass

- Low SSB for last 2 years:

	- Weak year class (no action), or
	- Start of overfishing

- Risk for manager:

	- Restrict fishery without need, vs
	- Not protecting overfished stocks

# Trade Offs

- Compatible objectives
- CCSBT


# Objectives

## Conservation

## Fisheries

##  Risks
- x % (e.g. 10%) risk of unnecessarily restricting fisheries
	- P(F > F@MSY) < 10%
- y% (e.g. 5%) risk of not protecting overfished stocks
	- P(SSB < SSB@LIM) < 5%

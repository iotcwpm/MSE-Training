# What is MSE?

**Testing** the **performance** of a **Management Procedure** to deliver a set of **objectives** under **uncertainty** and for a range of scenarios.

a.k.a. Management Procedure Approach

# SA-based SC advice

- Best stock assessment
- Comparison with reference points
- Yearly assessment + advice

# Problems with SA

- SA uncertain or wrong

# Problems with SA

- SA uncertain or wrong
- Inter-annual changes in SA

# Problems with SA

- SA uncertain or wrong
- Inter-annual changes in SA
- Short time horizon
- Management objectives unclear
- Stakeholder distance

# MSE output

- Relative comparison of performance of different Management Systems under uncertainty
	- Is Plan A riskier than Plan B?

- Contribution of each source of data to ability to manage
	- What does the MP need as input?
	- Value of fisheries-independent data, e.g. tagging

# The 6 STEPS

1. Specify & prioritize objectives
2. Quantify them as performance measures
3. Develop a set of OMs
	- Condition on data
4. Identify candidate MPs (SA + HCR)
5. Simulate the future
	- Generate data
	- Determine management action
	- Apply to fleet and stock
6. Summarize performance of MPs
7. Select best MP

# MSE Advantages

- Evaluation of risk
- Robust performance over tracking noise in data
- Limits catch variability
- Consistent with PA
- Interaction among scientists, managers & stakeholders
- Default management if no agreement
- Less haggling for short term benefits

# MSE Disadvantages

- Lengthy complex development (but less and less so)
- Overly rigid
- Autopiloting?
- Poor data, poor models
- Choosing scenarios, test cases
- Not all possible scenarios covered

# Risk

- Probability of some undesirable event happening
- Farmer: sell your crop or sell later at (possibly) higher price?
- Investment: Keep shares while they rise or sell before they fall?

# Dilemma of low biomass

- Low SSB for last 2 years:

	- Weak year class (no action), or
	- Start of overfishing

- Risk for manager:

	- Restrict fishery without need, vs
	- Not protecting overfished stocks

# Trade Offs

- High catch, low variability, high SSB: compatible objectives?

# Objectives

## Conservation

- Safe SSB levels
- Ecosystem considerations
- Avoid recruitment and growth overfishing

## Fisheries

- Economically and socially viable catch levels
- Stability in expected catches

# Objectives

##  Risks
- x % (e.g. 10%) risk of unnecessarily restricting fisheries
	- P(F > F@MSY) < 10%
- y% (e.g. 5%) risk of not protecting overfished stocks
	- P(SSB < SSB@LIM) < 5%

# Wrap Up

- Objectives: to best manage we need direction

- Risk: need to think about them

- Management System: Data + Decision rule + Management tools

- Dialogue with managers: objectives, risks

- MSE not magic wand, but powerful tool

*Prediction is very difficult, specially if it is about the future*
